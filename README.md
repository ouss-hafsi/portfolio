# Portfolio Introduction

I wanted to design an online portfolio that would be functional and appealing. Portfolio design is something that 
I’m passionate about because it gives creators a unique platform to present their work to a wide audience. As a user, I want to see a portfolio that is simple to understand and easy to navigate through. I also hope to see an array of different projects that are straightforward to access and view. In the case that I would like to learn more about a person’s work, I would like to be able to easily access their social media links as well as obtain information about their background, services offered, and contact information/instructions.
